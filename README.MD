# GoPostExploit
GoPostExploit is a multi-platform post-exploitation tool written in Go. It includes a server and client (agent). The agent beacons to the server regularly via http POST requests. The server sends back a list of commands to execute on the client in response to the beacon. Core commands consist of port forwards, reverse shell, and configuration modifications.

To minimize detection and enhance forensics resistance:
- All GoPostExploit communications are encrypted and blend in with normal traffic. By default, beacons use HTTPS, while reverse shells and port forwards utilize SSH tunnels.
- The http server mirrors a default nginx setup to external parties.
- Key strings within the agent binary, including configuration, are encrypted using an AES random key.
- The agent configuration is adaptable, allowing the user to set the beacon interval, user agent of beacons, and beacon end points among other parameters.

GoPostExploit should not be used for illegal activities. It has no integrated functionality for criminal acts, nor will it be added. This means, for instance, that there is no p
